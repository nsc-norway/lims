# Clarity 6.2 upgrade procedure / notes

This file is the primary description of the installation procedure. Any configuration that
can be automated is performed using ansible.

Procedure outline:

* Back up the old instance
* Perform a clean install on a new host
* Restore old database and files
* Testing

The procedure may also be relevant for a complete clean install.


**Note that the .sh files are not sufficient, you may have to do some steps which are only given
here in the README file.**

## Decommissioning and preparation

### 10. Check and back up old instance: 10-postpare-old-instance.sh

Take a snapshot of the LIMS server.

After running / examining this script, transfer the backup to the new instance.


## 20. Preparing the new instance

Pre-installation requirements: https://genologics.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024942472

The text file 20-new-instance-spec-requirements.txt specified the necessary tasks.

### Scripts used on sandbox / CEES LIMS:

First run:

* 21-sandbox-lims.sh: Specific to sandbox-lims.sequencing.uio.no
* 21-cees-lims.sh: Specific to cees-lims.sequencing.uio.no (TODO)

Then run the general preparation script.

* 22-new-instance-prep-uio-rhel.sh: Concrete commands used to configure the new instance.


### OUS network nodes -- Before Ansible

Set up the partitions for /opt and /var.

    # mkfs /dev/sdb
    # mkdir /mnt/new
    # mount /dev/sdb /mnt/new
    # cp -apx /var/* /mnt/new
    # mv /var /var.old
    # umount /mnt/new

If /opt has something in it, repeat the same procedure for /opt and /dev/sdc instead of
/var and /dev/sdb. Delete /mnt/new. Add entries into fstab.

Add to /etc/fstab:

    /dev/sdb	/var	ext4	defaults	0 0
    /dev/sdc	/opt	ext4	defaults	0 0

Mount, and mark the filesystems to be relabeled by SELinux. If you have already run ansible
and thus disabled SELinux, then this is not possible nor necessary.

    # touch {/,/var,/opt}/.autorelabel

Reboot. Remove /var.old if all is okay. Check df.

### OUS network nodes part 2

After applying the ansible role, set the password for the clarity DB user:

    sudo -u postgres psql -c '\password clarity'

The DB password is stored in the nscadmin repo.

Also set the password for the diagnostics database access user diagprod. This password is not
stored anywhere after the install (by NSC), so if you have to set this, use a new randomly
generated password and inform them.

    sudo -u postgres psql -c '\password diagprod'

The ansible roles for limsservers are then enough to make the servers ready for the next
step.

### Permissions on primary storage

#### OUS network nodes

1. Get UIDs by checking the local user ID (UID) on the Clarity server.

id glsai; id glsjboss

3. Create local users on Isilon in the LOCAL: System provider with these UID, any names (example glsai-new glsjboss-new below)

2. Configure inheritable read prermission to the root of runScratch (running as root on the Isilon)

    cd /ifs/dta
    chmod +a user glsjboss-new allow generic_read,object_inherit,container_inherit runScratch
    chmod +a user glsai-new allow generic_read,object_inherit,container_inherit runScratch

3. Configure permission to specific locations

    chmod -R +a user glsjboss-new allow dir_gen_execute,generic_write,generic_read,std_delete,object_inherit,container_inherit gls_events_*
    chmod +a user glsai-new allow dir_gen_execute,dir_gen_read SampleSheets
    chmod +a user glsai-new allow dir_gen_execute,generic_read,object_inherit,container_inherit processed
    chmod -R +a user glsai-new allow dir_gen_execute,generic_write,generic_read,object_inherit,container_inherit SampleSheets/*
    chmod +a user glsai-new allow dir_gen_execute,generic_write,generic_read,container_inherit,inherit_only SampleSheets

#### cees-lims

/etc/fstab: `biolinux2.uio.no:/storage/nscdata/runsIllumina  /storage/nscdata/runsIllumina   nfs     defaults`

Create: /storage/nscdata/runsIllumina

Add glsjboss and glsai to nscdata group locally on the LIMS server(!). Edit /etc/group and add:

nscdata:x:71148:glsjboss,glsai


## 30. Installation and validation

Now the host should have its intended final hostname. Change the hostname and IP address now if
required. The script expects that the backup contents have been unpacked in `/opt/backup`.

Add an entry for the local server in /etc/hosts (re-run ansible site.yml on OUS network). On
UiO net, add the short one-component hostname to the line with the local server. It will only
have something like `cees-lims.sequencing`, not `cees-lims`. The short name should be the
last on the line.

The installation process is too interactive to automate with ansible. The commands in
`30-lims-install.sh` can be used to perform the installation on both UiO and OUS sites.


## 40. Restore and initialise

Follow the script `40-restore-db-and-configure.sh`, but it is recommended to enter the
commands manually one by one, and adapt any as necessary.

This script also installs the generally available add-ons: Pre-configured workflow package
and NGS package.



### Set permissions to make it easier for multiple users to work

After performing the restore operation, set default full permissions for the limsdev group.

Set both default (-d) permissions and effective permissions.

#### ous-lims/dev-lims

    sudo setfacl -R -d -m g:lims-dev:rwx /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions
    sudo setfacl -R -m g:lims-dev:rwx /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions

#### cees-lims/sandbox-lims

    sudo setfacl -R -d -m g:ous-nsc-lims-dev:rwx /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions
    sudo setfacl -R -m g:ous-nsc-lims-dev:rwx /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions


## 50. Post-install configuration

Perform steps in 50-post-install... script.

And install local NSC-python virtual environments.

Validate that the LIMS works and all the data are there. Then delete /opt/backup. Cleanup temp hostname
from /etc/hosts if present.

### OUS node: Create principals view

The following view to grant access to principals without password column. Run in psql as
postgres user:

    sudo -u postgres psql -c 'CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW principalsview AS SELECT principalid, username, isvisible, isloggedin, datastoreid, ownerid, isglobal, createddate, lastmodifieddate, lastmodifiedby, accountlocked, researcherid, locked, hasloggedin FROM principals;' clarityDB


## 60. Install optional components
