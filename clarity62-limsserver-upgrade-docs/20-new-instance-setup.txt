# New instance setup

First install the OS using the GUI installer, according to the wiki.
Select the first disk sda as the installation destination and choose to free all the space on it.
Leave the other disks sdb and sdc alone.

After install, BEFORE RUNNING ANSIBLE, set up /var and /opt:

Make sure to have a backup.

----
wipefs -a /dev/sdb
wipefs -a /dev/sdc

# VAR
mkdir /var/lib/pgsql
mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb

# OPT  
mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdc
----


Add to /etc/fstab. Use UUIDs from /dev/disk/by-uuid, NOT the device names given below.
The device names sdb and sdc are not stable in all situations in OL8. See the other entries
in fstab.

    /dev/sdb	/var/lib/pgsql	xfs	defaults	0 0
    /dev/sdc	/opt	xfs	defaults	0 0

Reboot and confirm mounting.
